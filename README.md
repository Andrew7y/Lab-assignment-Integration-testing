# README
This repository is part of the Software Quality Assurance coursework. This project involves integration testing of a library book borrowing system simulator and a unit conversion program.
## Project Overview
The project focuses on testing the integration of various components within the library book borrowing system and the unit conversion program.
### Library Book Borrowing System
The system allows users to borrow books from the library.
### Unit Conversion Program
Integration testing will be performed on the unit conversion program. This involves creating a Stub to simulate the conversion of kilometers to meters.
## Features
- User management
- Book management
- Borrowing records
- Unit conversion (kilometers to meters)
## Technologies Used
- Python
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- Java
- JUnit
## How to Run
1. Set up the Python environment and install dependencies.
2. Run the FastAPI server.
3. Use the provided Java classes and tests to interact with and test the system.
## Testing
Integration tests are provided to ensure the system works as expected when different components interact.
